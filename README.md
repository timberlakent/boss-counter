# boss-counter
An app that tracks progression and improvement in the video game Dark Souls 3.

The purpose of this app is so that players can use this as a game-extension almost. While your playing the game you can track your progress here with things like Name, what run your on, deaths, and notes. The app also gives info on where the bosses are, their names, health, how many souls(currency in game) they drop and what they are weak to. 

The replayability in this game is one of the main reasons why I chose to create this. There are so many different outcomes and possibilities each time you play the game. So as a player, I wanted to store my progress in a database so that anytime I play I can start to track it and see how I am progressing. 

I really am happy with the style of my app. I am a huge fan om simplicty and ease of acess and I think both shine here. Some apps can throw too much info on a screen at one time and it can cause a user to feel lost when using it. This app is straight to the point with everything being extremely easy to understand.

HOW TO USE BOSS COUNTER:

Locations: this is the landing page. Here you will see a list of all locations(bonfires) in the game. Simply choose the location you are currently at in your game. 
Once you pick a location you will be redirected to that specific locations page. Here you will see all the Bosses that are in this area. 
Once you go to fight one of the bosses in the area simply click on that bosses name and it will bring you to a customized page of that boss.
Here you can see an image of the boss(easier to tell if this is who you are fighting rather than names), a short description of info on that boss. And below, you can find your stored data. 
While playing the game, click on "New Run" under the correct boss page. Enter your name and run number that you are currently on. After that you can add data by simply  licking arrows to account for your deaths, as well as a notes section. Here you can add whatever you like, maybe some helpful tips and reminders to help you win. 
after you have defeated the boss hit "Add Run" and your data will be saved. If you made a mistake you can always go back and make edits to that run. Or, if you dont feel like saving that specific run you can also delete it.
